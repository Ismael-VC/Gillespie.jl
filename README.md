## Statement of need

This is an implementation of [Gillespie's direct method](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gillespie_algorithm) for performing stochastic simulations, which are widely used in many fields, including systems biology and epidemiology. It borrows the basic interface (although none of the code) from the R library [`GillespieSSA`](http://www.jstatsoft.org/v25/i12/paper) by Mario Pineda-Krch, although `Gillespie.jl` only implements the standard exact method at present, whereas `GillespieSSA` also includes tau-leaping, *etc.*. It is intended to offer performance on par with hand-coded C code; please file an issue if you find an example that is significantly slower (2 to 5 times) than C.

## Installation

```Gillespie.jl``` can be installed from the Julia REPL using the following command.

```julia
Pkg.clone("http://github.com/sdwfrost/Gillespie.jl")
```

## Example usage

An example of a [susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) epidemiological model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compartmental_models_in_epidemiology#The_SIR_model_without_vital_dynamics) is as follows.

```julia
using Gillespie
using Gadfly

function F(x,parms)
  (S,I,R) = x
  (beta,gamma) = parms
  infection = beta*S*I
  recovery = gamma*I
  [infection,recovery]
end

x0 = [999,1,0]
nu = [[-1 1 0];[0 -1 1]]
parms = [0.1/1000.0,0.01]
tf = 250.0
srand(1234)

result = ssa(x0,F,nu,parms,tf)

data = ssa_data(result)

p=plot(data,
  layer(x="time",y="x1",Geom.step,Theme(default_color=color("red"))),
  layer(x="time",y="x2",Geom.step,Theme(default_color=color("blue"))),
  layer(x="time",y="x3",Geom.step,Theme(default_color=color("green"))),
  Guide.xlabel("Time"),
  Guide.ylabel("Number"),
  Guide.manual_color_key("Population",
                            ["S", "I", "R"],
                            ["red", "blue", "green"]),
  Guide.title("SIR epidemiological model"))
```

Julia versions of the examples used in [`GillespieSSA`](http://www.jstatsoft.org/v25/i12/paper) are given in the [examples](https://github.com/sdwfrost/Gillespie.jl/blob/master/examples) directory.

Passing functions as arguments in Julia (currently) incurs a performance penalty. One can circumvent this by passing an immutable object, with ```call``` overloaded, as follows.

```julia
immutable G; end
call(::Type{G},x,parms) = F(x,parms)
```

An example of this approach is given [here](https://github.com/sdwfrost/Gillespie.jl/blob/master/examples/sir2.jl).
